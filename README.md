# üéÑ Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges from various years. Each year, I aim to use a different programming language or paradigm to keep things interesting and to expand my skill set.

## üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è For Posterity

Get started by reviewing the answers to the following questions:

- [How can I help?](./CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [How should I behave here?](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- [How do I report security concerns?](./SECURITY.md)
- [What third-party dependencies are used?](./NOTICES.md)

## üóíÔ∏è Breakdown

Each year has its own directory with a README file that outlines the language and tools used, as well as instructions on how to run the solutions.

|Year|Focus|
|----|-----|
|[2015](./puzzles/2015/README.md)|C# Scripts|

### ‚úÖ Language Plan

The following years are unsolved as of today and will be completed as time permits, using the [TIOBE language of the year](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) as the primary driver for the language choice. If a language is repeated in the index, I will choose a different language, or use different patterns within the language to keep things interesting.
