# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2015

This year, I am using C# scripts to solve each puzzle. C# scripts are a great way to quickly prototype and solve problems without the overhead of creating a full project. I am using `dotnet-script` to run the scripts from the command line.

<sub>See the [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/2015) for this year's puzzles.</sub>

## ðŸ’» Setup

1. Install the .NET SDK from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
2. Install `dotnet-script` by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-script
```

3. Clone this repository to your local machine.
4. Navigate to the directory of the puzzle you want to solve and run the script using:

```bash
dotnet script DayX.csx
```

<sub>Replace `DayX.csx` with the appropriate file name for the puzzle you are solving.</sub>
