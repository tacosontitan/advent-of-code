# 🎄 Advent of Code 2025

This year, I am using Kotlin to solve each puzzle. Kotlin scripts are a great way to quickly prototype and solve problems without the overhead of creating a full project. I am using the [runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner) extension in VS Code to execute the scripts directly.

<sub>See the [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/2025) for this year's puzzles.</sub>
